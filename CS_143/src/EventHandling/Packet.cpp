/**
 * Create a Packet object.

 * @param id an ID representing the Packet.
 * @param fd the destination of the Packet.
 * @param src the source of the Packet.
 * @param s the size of the Packet.
 * @param a true if the Packet is an ack.
 * @param seq the sequence number of the Packet.  In the case of a data Packet,
 * this will usually (but not always) be an int version of the id of the Packet.
 * In the case of an ack, this will usually be the next Packet expected.
 * @param flow_id the id of the Flow from which the Packet was sent.
 * @param sync true if the Packet is a SYN
 * @param finish true if the Packet is a FIN
 * @param ts a timestamp associated with the Packet.  For data packets, this
 * will be the time at which the Packet is sent, but for acks, this will be
 * the time at which the ack's data Packet was sent.
 * @param bf true if the Packet is a bellman ford packet (Router use only).
 * @param bf_t a representation of the routing table, if bf=true.
 * Empty otherwise.
